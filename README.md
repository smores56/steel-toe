## How to Order

The [gerber ZIP](./pcb/production/gerber.zip) has everything you'll need to get this printed.
You can order from [JLC](https://jlcpcb.com) by just uploading that ZIP archive and keeping
the default options. I'd suggest removing the order number, otherwise they'll put
one on the board somewhere randomly.
